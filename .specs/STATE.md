## Decisions

### AD-001

- **Decision**: Agent always-on is a thin `AGENTS.md` (contract + pointers). `CLAUDE.md` is
  `@AGENTS.md`. Project decisions are looked up via `.specs/AD-INDEX.md`, not by reading
  `.specs/STATE.md`. Planner, implementer and verifier are three windows with different
  packets; models live only on the agent files. The delivery loop is unchanged.
- **Reason**: A `CLAUDE.md` symlink made Cursor inject the contract twice. Design/resume paid
  for the whole decision log. Packets cut that without adding a TLC phase or a front/back split.
- **Trade-off**: Role prose is copied per provider so spawn does not follow a pointer; the
  three copies can drift. Accepted over a renderer until a packet change actually diverges.
  Adopt copies agent folders only when the destination has none, so model pins survive re-adopt.
- **Scope**: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`,
  `.specs/AD-INDEX.md`, `tools/ad-index.py`, `scripts/adopt.py`.
