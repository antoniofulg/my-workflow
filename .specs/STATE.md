## Decisions

### AD-001

- **Decision**: Agent always-on is a thin `AGENTS.md` (contract + pointers). `CLAUDE.md` is
  `@AGENTS.md`. Project decisions are looked up via `.specs/AD-INDEX.md`, not by reading
  `.specs/STATE.md`. Planner, implementer and verifier are three windows with different
  packets; models live only on the agent files. The delivery loop is unchanged.
- **Reason**: A `CLAUDE.md` symlink made Cursor inject the contract twice. Design/resume paid
  for the whole decision log. Packets cut that without adding a TLC phase or a front/back split.
- **Trade-off**: Role prose is copied per provider so spawn does not follow a pointer; the
  three copies can drift. Accepted over a renderer until a packet change actually diverges.
  Adopt copies agent folders only when the destination has none, so model pins survive re-adopt.
- **Scope**: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`,
  `.specs/AD-INDEX.md`, `tools/ad-index.py`, `scripts/adopt.py`.

### AD-002

- **Decision**: QA planning and QA execution are separate provider-neutral skills dispatched in fresh
  sessions by the existing Verifier. The consuming project selects its adapter through
  `docs/qa/README.md`; the workflow does not mandate or install a QA framework.
- **Reason**: Independent review must be stable across Cursor, Claude and Codex while the consuming
  product remains free to use browser, API, CLI, mobile or manual tooling.
- **Trade-off**: Each consuming project maintains a small operational profile, and a missing runner
  can leave documented manual or blocked legs instead of automatic framework installation.
- **Scope**: `.agents/skills/qa-plan/`, `.agents/skills/qa-execute/`, provider `verifier` packets,
  `docs/qa/README.md`, QA guidelines and workflow docs.

### AD-003

- **Decision**: `.specs/features/` is ignored local state. Durable project decisions remain tracked in
  `.specs/STATE.md` and indexed by `.specs/AD-INDEX.md`; task commits no longer include `tasks.md`.
- **Reason**: Feature specs, designs, tasks, memory and validation reports are execution scaffolding,
  not the public workflow contract.
- **Trade-off**: A fresh clone cannot resume an in-progress local feature from Git; the active
  checkout owns its planning state until durable knowledge is promoted.
- **Scope**: `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, TLC workflow guidance, artifact lifecycle and commit evidence.
