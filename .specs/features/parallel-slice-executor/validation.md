# Parallel Slice Executor Validation

**Verdict**: PASS
**Date:** 2026-08-24
**Phase:** Technical Verification
**Scope:** Slice A only: T1, T2, T2R4, and T2R5
**Spec:** `.specs/features/parallel-slice-executor/spec.md`
**Diff range:** `d73071c..fac5577`
**Incremental remediation:** `2ae0482..fac5577`
**Verifier:** independent Verifier, author != verifier

This verdict closes only Slice A technical verification. It does not verify T3-T7, mark the feature
complete, run deep-review, or perform QA Plan/QA Execute.

## Verdict

T1/T2 outcomes and their assigned contract cases are directly asserted. T2R5 closes the prior
IT-001 fingerprint: public `main(["resume", ...])` now receives a safe-mode adapter seam, loads a
persisted pending worker receipt, reconciles it, emits one correlated `resume` JSON result, and
performs no replacement effect. Removing the adapter from that public resume path kills the suite.

T2R4 also matches AD-012: remediation accounting is keyed by requirement, root cause, and concrete
failure path; only the third failed remediation of the same fingerprint halts, while a distinct
blocker starts independently.

## Task and Contract Disposition

| Owner | Case | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | UT-001 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:90-100` asserts illegal/out-of-order transitions; `:188-202` asserts disabled serial/no adapter construction; `:712-732,901-930` assert one active same-slice task and exact order. | PASS |
| T1 | UT-003 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:103-116,774-835` assert foreign, malformed, nested-secret, and unreconciled state serializes before adapter effects. | PASS |
| T1 | SEC-001 | `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py:71-174` validates nested state/action/lease receipts; `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:806-835` asserts malformed nested state yields fallback and `adapter.effects == []`. | PASS |
| T1 | SEC-002 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:119-148` asserts Git-common placement, no versioned receipt, and preservation of prior JSON across injected pre-rename failure. | PASS |
| T1 | SEC-003 | `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py:227-248`; `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:151-168` asserts exact argv, `shell is False`, and bounded timeout. | PASS |
| T1 | SEC-004 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:170-184,867-880` asserts traversal/symlink/escape rejection and zero adapter effects. | PASS |
| T2 | UT-002 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:246-265` asserts accepted replay creates no new effects; `:748-769,1014-1057` assert pending worktree/acquire/worker/release reconciliation without repeated effects. | PASS |
| T2 | UT-007 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:299-348` asserts `Resources: none` makes zero provider calls and a resource lane starts only with a correlated prepared/redacted lease. | PASS |
| T2 | UT-008 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:355-472,514-572` asserts malformed/duplicate/foreign/timeout/cleanup failure outcomes and exact-once owned cleanup. | PASS |
| T2 | IT-001 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:577-607` asserts one-object verb output and read-only status; `:610-686` seeds safe persisted pending state, invokes public `main(["resume", ...], adapter_factory=...)`, and asserts accepted correlated receipt, `adapter.reconciled == ["worker"]`, and `adapter.effects == []`. | PASS |
| T2 | SEC-007 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:514-534` asserts resource failures return serial recovery with zero worker dispatch; `:994-1009` proves persisted acquire precedes worker. | PASS |
| T2 | SEC-008 | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:355-391,539-553,1014-1057` asserts foreign release rejection, owned idempotent retry, and no repeated recovered release. | PASS |
| T2R4 | IT-008 | `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md:89-91` defines immutable per-fingerprint accounting; `tools/shared/tests/qa-skills.test.ts:237-260` asserts exact components, independent counters, third-failure halt, reopening retention, and canonical pointers. | PASS |

**Assigned-case status:** 13 PASS, 0 FAIL.

## Spec-Anchored Acceptance Criteria

| Requirement | Spec-defined outcome | Assertion evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXE-01 | Disabled returns serial and performs no worktree, worker, Git, planner, or resource effect. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:188-202,691-705` asserts `reason == "disabled-mode"`, serial lane, forbidden seams untouched, and adapter unconstructed. | PASS |
| EXE-02 | At most one active worker per slice; declared task order remains intact. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:712-732,901-930` asserts T2 is absent while T1 runs, then exact `worktree:T1, worker:T1, worktree:T2, worker:T2` order. | PASS |
| EXE-03 | Every external action has a persisted key derived from feature, slice, task, action, and source checkpoint before the effect. | Key material is `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py:333-335`; pending persistence is asserted at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:853-862,994-1009`. | PASS |
| EXE-04 | Restart reconciles persisted accepted/pending receipts without recreating worktree, worker, or lease effects. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:246-265,748-769,1014-1057`; public safe resume at `:610-686`; sensor M1 and M2 killed. | PASS |
| EXE-05 | Malformed, foreign, or unreconcilable state selects named serial recovery before adapter effects. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:774-835` asserts `state:`/`unreconciled-pending` reasons and `adapter.effects == []`. | PASS |
| EXE-18 | `Resources: none` permits worktree concurrency without acquisition. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:299-317` asserts successful dispatch, zero provider construction, and only worktree/worker effects; sensor M3 killed. | PASS |
| EXE-19 | Resource acquisition receives the complete argv-only correlated request before worker start. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:337-345,452-472,994-1009` asserts exact fields/argv/input and effect order. | PASS |
| EXE-20 | Only unique, correlated, prepared, resource-matching, redacted leases are accepted. | Normalizer is `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py:338-361`; assertions at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:396-472,1014-1057`. | PASS |
| EXE-21 | Missing, timed-out, malformed, duplicate, or cleanup-failed providers refuse parallel dispatch and report fallback. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:514-572` asserts exact fallback reasons, zero worker dispatch, and failed cleanup receipt. | PASS |
| EXE-22 | Accepted, halted, or abandoned workers release owned leases exactly once and retain evidence. | `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:355-391,539-553,1014-1057` asserts one provider release, released state, and idempotent replay. | PASS |
| EXE-23 | A blocking finding is fingerprinted by requirement, root cause, and concrete failure path, with its own failed-remediation count. | `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md:89-90`; `tools/shared/tests/qa-skills.test.ts:237-240`. | PASS |
| EXE-24 | A distinct blocker starts independently and does not consume a closed blocker's count. | `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md:91`; `tools/shared/tests/qa-skills.test.ts:241-243`. | PASS |
| EXE-25 | Same fingerprint halts only after three failed remediations; wording/reopening preserves identity and count. | `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md:89-91`; `tools/shared/tests/qa-skills.test.ts:240-243`. | PASS |

**Acceptance status:** 13 PASS, 0 FAIL for Slice A.

## Prior Blocker Reconciliation

| Fingerprint | Count/disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `IT-001/EXE-04 + CLI resume lacks adapter reconciliation + persisted pending safe-mode worker` | CLOSED by T2R5. The new assertion at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:610-686` proves the public entrypoint path; mandatory sensor M1 kills removing its adapter. No failed post-fix gate occurred in this verification. |
| T2R1-T2R3 distinct blockers | Remain closed by their existing direct assertions; they do not consume the IT-001 fingerprint count under AD-012 and `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md:89-91`. |

## Discrimination Sensor

Baseline real-tree porcelain was empty. Each mutation ran in its own detached temporary worktree at
`fac5577`; all scratches were removed. Real-tree porcelain returned to the same baseline before this
report edit.

| Mutation | Behavior fault | Directed result | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Public CLI `resume` passes no adapter factory to `Coordinator`, bypassing construction/reconciliation. | Executor suite exit 1 at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:680`, `assert result["fallback"] is False`. | KILLED |
| M2 | Pending worker always calls `start_worker` instead of `reconcile_action`, allowing a duplicate effect. | Executor suite exit 1 at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:683`, missing reconciled `external_id == "dispatch-resumed"`. | KILLED |
| M3 | `Resources: none` enters the acquisition branch and requires a provider. | Executor suite exit 1 at `tools/test_parallel_executor.py:861`, unexpected fallback. | KILLED |

**Sensor:** lightweight, 3 injected, 3 killed, 0 survived. PASS.

## Code Quality and Contract Integrity

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum/surgical T2R5 change | PASS: one optional entrypoint adapter seam and one contracted integration case. |
| No scope creep in incremental remediation | PASS: production change is limited to adapter selection/injection for non-status public commands. |
| IT-001 asserts contracted outcome rather than implementation shape | PASS: persisted pending state, correlated receipt, public `resume` JSON, and zero duplicate effects are observable assertions. |
| T1/T2 per-layer coverage and spec outcomes | PASS: 13/13 assigned cases, 13/13 Slice A EXE criteria, and 6/6 Slice A security requirements. |
| Hollow-case rule | PASS under `docs/guidelines/TEST-CONTRACT.md:47-55`; the prior hollow IT-001 path now fails when required reconciliation is removed. |

## Ranked Gaps

None for Slice A technical verification.

## Summary

**Overall:** PASS for Slice A only. T1/T2 and T2R4/T2R5 match their spec-defined outcomes; all
assigned tests and gates pass; all three behavior mutants die. T3-T7, feature completion,
deep-review, QA Plan, and QA Execute remain outside this verdict.
